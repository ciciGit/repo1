# Trees

Given the poem “Trees” by Joyce Kilmer, display the poem in a web page.


I think that I shall never see<br>
A poem lovely as a tree.
 
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br>
Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;
 
A tree that looks at God all day,<br>
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
 
A tree that may in Summer wear<br>
A nest of robins in her hair;
 
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;<br>
Who intimately lives with rain.
 
Poems are made by fools like me,<br>
But only God can make a tree.
