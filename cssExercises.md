- You can use the following fonts list for help: http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/fonts

This second challenge will help you to re-cap your CSS text formatting skills, as well as start using margins and padding. Use [shakespeareSonnet.html](https://stacked-prod.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/files/BYG5P5PJ.html) 
to get started, and the image above is what your page should look like. <br/><br/>

Hints:

- The thumbnails are not very representative, but this challenge requires you to create a fixed-width layout that is centered in the browser window.
- To get the wrap division to stay centered, you'll need to set the left and right margins to a_t_ (you've got to fill in the blanks).
